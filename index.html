  <h1>Kyle English's Important Notes</h1>
  <h2>Level 1</h2>
  <h3>How To Think Like A <em>Programmer</em></h3>
  <div class= notes>
    <p><b>1) Procedural</b> -> breaking problem into steps the computer follows
      <br> 2) <b>Abstract</b> -> 1+1=2
      <br> 3) <b>Systematic Debugging</b> a) Collect Evidence b) Generate theories c) Test d) Fix
      <br> 4) <b>Technical Empathy</b> -> what code means
      <br> 5) <b>Systems Thinking</b> -> breaking down problem then create a plan</p>
  </div>
  <h3>How The Web Works</h3>
  <div class= notes>
    <p>Web is a collection HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) pages. Your computer uses the internet and the protocol HTTP to communicate with servers which house the HTML code of webpages.</p>
  </div>
  <u>HTML Markup</u>
  <br>
  <div class= notes>
    <br>HTML relies on the creation of <b>elements</b> using tags that have an <em>opening</em> and a <em>closing</em>.
  </div>
  <br>
  <u>Tags</u>
  <br>
  <div class= notes>
    <p>HTML relies on tags so that browsers can correctly translate what will be displayed on the page. A good summary of tags tags can be seen
      <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs253/l-48737165/m-48723444">here</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <u>Inline vs Block</u>
  <br>
  <div class= notes>
    <p>Inline elements are different from block in that a block element will create an invisble <b>box</b> around the text.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Level 2</h2>
  <div class= notes>
    <h3>Web Development (Front End)</h3>
    <p>CSS, HTML, and Java Script are the three primary languages used in web design. HTML provdes structure (like the walls of a house), CSS provides style (decorations , paint, etc), while Java Script provides interactive components (like the garage door
      opener). In Chrome, clicking on the 3 stacked lines, then tools, then development tools will show you the structure of a page. It is best to think of elements being inside of an <b>invisible box</b>.</p>
    <h3>HTML's Tree Like Structure</h3>
    <div class= notes>
      <p>Boxes are <em>nested</em> inside other boxes. Each box provides the framwork for the for the text/video/image that you see on the screen. For example, HTML->Body->h1->text. HTML is thr trunk, body is a branch with other braches sprouting from it.
        The tip of the branch is what will be displayed inside that box on the screen by the browser. In other words, <b>the tags represent the branches of a tree</b>. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a page's tree structure.</p>
      <p>When designing a site, start with a collection of boxes then fill them in. Each box should be defined by a <em>div</em> tag.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>When To Use The Tools</h3>
    <div class= notes>
      <p><b>Scratchpad</b> is the easiest to use when writing HTML and CSS however, it is the least powerful.
        <b>Codepen</b> can be used to write and share code.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Use CSS....don't Repeat Yourself!</h3>
    <div class= notes>
      <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to add styles to classes in HTML code. This is language is essential in ensuring that programmers do not repeat themselves and can remain efficient.It does this by applying rules to elements/classes/descriptions.</p>
    </div>
    <u>Inheritance</u>
    <div class= notes>
      <p>This concept centers around the fact that properties are applied to specific elements <em>and</em> its descendants.</p>
    </div>
    <div class= notes>
      <h3>The Box Model</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Margin -> Border -> Padding -> Content. Pro tip: Set boxes as a percentage so they will change along with a user's screen size.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Code, Test, Refine</h3>
      <div class= notes>
        <p>1) Look for natural boxes
          <br>2) Look for repeated styles
          <br>3) Write HTML
          <br>4) Apply styles
          <br>5) Fix things</p>
